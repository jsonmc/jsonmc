  "description": "Primer is based on two engineers, Aaron and Abe, who accidentally invent a time travel device. The film explores the reality of time travel like no another film by incorporating real sicence into the consequences of interferring with your own timeline. Soon Abe and Aaron find that time travel may be more trouble than what its worth. \n A low-production but highly thought intrusive cult film that relies more on its ideas than high-quality acting and cinematography."
