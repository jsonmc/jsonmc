  "storyline": "In this episode Spook leave the crew and is replaced by Lt. Dwarf and commander Info. With the ships interiors also upgraded to full TNG status it's time to let it rip in full TNG mode. An alien race is having a(ahem) race to see who is most deserving of becoming their allies in this sector of space. Captain Pirk now has to race against both the Plingons and a mercenary hired by the Turengi, and has to solve the complex puzzle the aliens have created. Of course, he also have to contend with the utterly stupid helmsman. Again, animation quality is upgraded and again the scope of the universe is expanded, dialog is great as usual and this contains the memorable line 'Plingon warriors do not shower'. It is also the last one with an animated cast."
