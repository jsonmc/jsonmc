  "storyline": "The Paddington bear is already happily integrated into the home of the Brown family. He has also become a very popular member of the Windsor Gardens community. His aunt Lucy turns 100 and has the perfect gift for her: a pop-up book from Mr. Gruber's antique store. To be able to buy the book, Paddington will decide to perform a series of strange works. But everything gets complicated when the book is stolen."
