  "storyline": "The first-ever full-length theatrical LEGO® movie follows Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary, rules-following, perfectly average LEGO® minifigure who is mistakenly identified as the most extraordinary person and the key to saving the world. He is drafted into a fellowship of strangers on an epic quest to stop an evil tyrant, a journey for which Emmet is hopelessly and hilariously underprepared."
