However, the government, concerned by the collateral damage, shuts down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parrs without financial assistance from agent Rick Dicker. As Violet inadvertently revealed her superhero identity to her date, Tony, Dicker attempts to erase this knowledge from his memory, but accidentally wipes Violet from his mind entirely. That night, Lucius informs Bob and Helen of an offer from Winston Deavor, the owner of DevTech, a telecommunications corporation. Winston and his sister Evelyn propose a publicity stunt to regain public trust in superheroes."
