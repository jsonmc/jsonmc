    "storyline": "Akash (Ayushmann Khurrana) is a talented but seemingly blind pianist in search of inspiration. He spends his time fervently attempting to complete a musical piece which is an example of his finest art. The only people seemingly aware of his innocuous presence initially are a neighbouring kid who keeps testing him in attempts to see if he is truly blind, and a pet cat named Rani."
