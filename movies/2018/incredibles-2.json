  "storyline": "The Parrs, a family of superheroes, pursue the Underminer. Although the Underminer robs the Metroville Bank and escapes, the Parrs stop his drill tank from destroying City Hall with help from Lucius Best. However, the government, concerned about the collateral damage caused by the supers during the incident, shuts down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parrs without financial assistance from agent Rick Dicker. As Violet's date, Tony, discovered her superhero identity during the Underminer attack, Dicker erases her from his memory. That night, Lucius informs Bob and Helen of an offer from Winston Deavor, the owner of DevTech, a telecommunications corporation. Winston and his sister Evelyn propose a publicity stunt to regain public trust in superheroes."
