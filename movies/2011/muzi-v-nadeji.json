On the contrary, his promiscuous father-in-law Rudolf who lives next door has a happy marriage of 35 years with Marta. As his marriage gets increasingly boring, Rudolf encourages him to imitate him to save his marriage. He rejects it but he changes his mind after he meets Sarlota, a new date of Rudolf."
