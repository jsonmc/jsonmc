  "description": "When her majesty's crown jewels are stolen by a conniving Frenchman, who also plans to steal the queen's throne, spy Johnny English, a bit unseasoned but intensely enthusiastic, is thrown onto the case. Fast cars, high tech gadgets, top secret info--Johnny can hardly believe it. He may be in over his head, but his courage and dedication are unmatched--especially after he meets double agent Lorna Campbell and discovers that falling in love makes saving the nation even more exciting.",
