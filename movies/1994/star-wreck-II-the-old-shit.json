  "storyline": "In this radically updated Star Wreck we get 3D animated ships and 2D interior shots. Here the character of Fukov(ahem) is properly established and weird humor that is to pervade this series get its first real outing. Again the CPP Kickstart is sent to fight the Plingons, and more background information is given(The CPP Kickstart is on its 5 month mission to seek out alien life and blow it up). It is the original series that gets the Star Wreck treatment this time and the incessantly swearing captain Pirk gets to abuse Fukov as well as the Plingons. Spook also makes an appearance as the only somewhat competent crew member of the highly dysfunctional Kickstart. As this is only 9 minutes the story focuses primarily on the battle, but you can see the outline of things to come. Also, it is best to see this series in the proper order as the next episodes will refer back to the previous episodes, and this is the beginning of the story that will ultimately lead to the final(and hopefully not last) episode."
