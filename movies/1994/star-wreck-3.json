  "storyline": "In this first really ambitious story by Samuli Torssonen and Rudi Airisto captain Pirk uncovers an Romuclan plot to destroy P-fleet. Whilst animation quality is much the same as in episode 2 exteriors are upgraded and elements from TNG has started to appear, though the action is still centered around Fukov, Spook and Pirk. Lots of great dialog in this one. The interior shots are still done using primarily 2D animation and the characters are still crudely animated, there is now 3D elements also in the character animation, and we get to see the first away mission in the series. The concept of the expendable crewman is introduced here with 2nd Lt. Cannonfodder. The scope of the series is expanded with alien planets, star dock, and star bases. We also get to see the hold that P-fleet command has over a coward like Pirk, but also how cunning Pirk can be at his best as he takes on the Romuclan fleet."
